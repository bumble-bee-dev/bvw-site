The Ballater Victoria Week Duck Race is the only duck race where 1,440 racing  ducks are blasted across the village green on a makeshift river created by members of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.
This year it takes place on Sunday 17th August at 1pm.

There are few changes to the way the race operates from previous years...
1) Our prize fund has doubled, so first duck past the finish line wins its ticket holder a feathery £500, second wins £200 and third £100.
2) The Duck colours and tickets will no longer be assigned to different organisations and charities to sell for their own funds. Instead, after the prize fund has been paid out, all proceeds will be divided equally between three specific groups - The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Family Support Trust, The Victoria and Albert Halls (Ballater) Trust and Ballater Victoria Week - and the final quarter will be made available and split between local groups and organisations (via a very simple bidding process). If all tickets for the BVW Duck Race are sold, each of the three named organisations, and the fourth "divvied up" pot, will stand to gain around £800 each.
3) Tickets will be priced at £3 each. There are 120 each of the 12 Duck colours.

Best of luck to everybody and every duck, and thank you for your support of the BVW Duck Race.
