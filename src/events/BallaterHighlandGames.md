You are invited to join the traditional Highland Games this year on Thursday 14th August in Monaltrie Park in the village.
Known as the Friendly Games on Royal Deeside for good reason, and you can be assured of a warm welcome.
Our full programme has pipe bands; piping and highland dancing competitions; track and light field events; a hill race; heavy field events including tossing the caber; tug o’war; children’s races, including sack races; and tilt the bucket fun.
To add to your interest and enjoyment, there is our fast food court, beer tent, an interesting variety of trade and craft stalls, and a funfair.
Our gates open at 10am, competitions start at 11am, and the formal opening is at noon.
